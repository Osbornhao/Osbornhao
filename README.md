## About me [![LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-%230077B5.svg?logo=linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guanyu-hao-ab2624233/)
## As a Front-End Developer, I independently developed various innovative websites using Vue 3, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My notable projects include a platform for job candidates to showcase their work, a reaction speed test site, a "Color Plaid" game, and a discussion website for friends. My role entailed implementing front-end tasks based on designers' and product managers' specifications. These projects, although not yet released, demonstrate my technical proficiency and innovative approach in front-end development.
